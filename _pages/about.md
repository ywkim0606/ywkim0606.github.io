I am a Master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology advised by Prof. Frank Dellaert. My research objective is to create robots that can make intelligent decisions based on the environment and possible actions. My current research focuses on creating a unified probabilistic framework using a factor graph representation to plan in discrete and continuous state spaces. I am interested in leveraging learning-based methods such as reinforcement learning and latent state representations to push the boundaries of task and motion planning.
