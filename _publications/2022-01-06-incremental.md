Object grounding tasks aim to locate the target object in an image through verbal communications. Understanding human command is an important process needed for effective human-robot communication. However, this is challenging because human commands can be ambiguous and erroneous. This paper aims to disambiguate the human's referring expressions by allowing the agent to ask relevant questions based on semantic data obtained from scene graphs. We test if our agent can use relations between objects from a scene graph to ask semantically relevant questions that can disambiguate the original user command. In this paper, we present Incremental Grounding using Scene Graphs (IGSG), a disambiguation model that uses semantic data from an image scene graph and linguistic structures from a language scene graph to ground objects based on human command. Compared to the baseline, IGSG shows promising results in complex real-world scenes where there are multiple identical target objects. IGSG can effectively disambiguate ambiguous or wrong referring expressions by asking disambiguating questions back to the user.
